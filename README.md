# **Welcome**

My name is Brock Vance and I am a senior in the Computer Science program at Western Oregon University. This page was created to 
serve as my portfolio. While I have many years of experience with languages such as Java, C/C++, and Python, I have worked with web-based applications very little and look forward to learning new skills through this sequence.
