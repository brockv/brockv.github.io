# **Homework IV**

The task for this assignment was to learn the C# language by translating a Java application into a C# console application, using Visual Studio for our IDE. Having a strong background in both C++ and Java coming into this sequence, this particular assignment was straightforward and fairly simple.

### **I: Setting Up the  Project**

This step was halfway done as I already had Visual Studio setup on both my desktop and laptop from previous projects. Because of this, I was able to spend more time looking through the code we were given, and learning how each file worked. The project we were provided with accepted a single integer from the user at the command line and produced binary representations of numbers up to the one provided, starting from 1.


### **II: Starting the Conversion to C#**

As was suggested in the homework assignment, I started with Node, then QueueInterface, QueueUnderflowException, LinkedQueue, and finally Main.


### **III: Making Sure Everything Works**


### **IV: Merging Back Into the Master Branch**

Finally, it was time to merge the feature branch into the master branch.

```bash
git checkout master
git merge HWK4-feature-branch
git push -u origin master
```
