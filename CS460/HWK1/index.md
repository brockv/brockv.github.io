# **Homework I**

The first homework assignment we were given was to create several webpages. We were to use HTML to build the pages, CSS to style them, and Bootstrap to format the layout. I had very little experience with HTML going into this and had never heard of Bootstrap before, so the first thing I did was dive into some documentation. I found [this](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) link especially helpful for learning the little things that Bootstrap was capable of, and used them to tailor the pages to my liking.

### **I: Getting a Repository Setup Through Git**

I had previously set up an account through GitHub so most of the work was done already. After creating the repository in my account, the
next step was to clone it on my local machine using Git Bash since part of the assignment requirements was to use Git strictly from the
command line. After doing so, I created a directory for the repository on my machine, cloned the repository to it, then navigated to the 
directory using the following commands:

```
mkdir CS460
git clone https://github.com/brockv/CS460.git
cd CS460
```

Throughout this assignment, I used commands such as add, commit, push, and pull to make changes to the files and to keep the repositories in sync and up to date. Specifically, the 'add' command is used to stage files that have been modified, and 'commit' is used to save the changes. Commits should be accompanied by a message to indicate the changes that were made. The 'push' and 'pull' commands are used to send and retrieve files from the repository, respectively.

```
git add file_to_add.html
git commit -m "Fixed a broken link."
git push -u origin master
```

### **II: Creating the Content**

For this assignment there were expectations for the layout, but there were no requirements for the content of the pages themselves. Because of this I opted to focus on presentation instead, and used generic placeholder text and some images from earlier classes. As far as the layout, we were expected to use single and multi-column layouts, and include a table, two different lists, a navigation bar, and a seperate cascading style sheet (CSS) to style the pages. 

### **III: Using Bootstrap to Manage Page Layouts**

Prior to this assignment I had never heard of Bootstrap and I didn't quite understand how to integrate it into our project.

### **IV: Publishing the Pages Using GitPages**
